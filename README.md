## Sample otp login page with handled almost all exceptions using pure html, css and js

The Html is fully responsive and you can use this sample in both "RTL" and "LTR" projects without any problem. but if you are using RTL direction, the decimal direction is still LTR, so you need to use ```row-reverse``` for ```fieldset``` display ```flex-direction``` class.

thank you.
